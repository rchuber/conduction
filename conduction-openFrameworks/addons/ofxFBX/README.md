![FBX version 7.4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickHardeman/ofxFBX/master/ReadMeImages/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-11%20at%201.45.10%20PM.png)

Currently only supporting OSX. Tested with OF v0.08 and OSX 10.8-10.10.

### WIP. Currently adding features to this addon.

Features include:
* Multiple Animations with individual control
* External Bone Control with Animations
* Textures
* Cameras
* Materials
* Cached meshes and scenes for faster rendering
* Poses
* Individual mesh manipulation
* Enable and disable rendering of certain assets in the scene

### Blender workflow. 
Using Blender 2.63, the FBX exporter is not fully featured and there are known bugs that may be fixed in the future.
Apply any transformations before exporting using ctrl + A. http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Fade/Doc:2.6/Manual/3D_interaction/Transform_Control/Reset_Object_Transformations

When exporting, be sure to set the **_Forward_** to **_Y Forward_** and the **_Up_** to **_Z Up_**.
